		<p> My name is Perla Showell. I am from Arlington, Virginia. I am a George Mason graduate with a B.S. in Environmental Science. I also completed about two years worth of classes in the field of engineering. I am artistic in nature and enjoy drawing on my free time.</p>
		<p> On July second of twenty-seventeen, I married the love of my life and bestfriend, Brandon Showell. A few days before our wedding, my husband participated in The Voices' blind auditions and got 3 chairs to turn! The journey has been nothing short of a wild ride, but I am feeling inspired now, more than I have ever been, to follow my dreams and learn the tools I need to express myself through software development. </p>
